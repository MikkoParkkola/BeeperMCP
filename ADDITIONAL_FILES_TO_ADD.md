Recommended additional files to add to the chat/repo (suggested to enable full build, runtime and tests):

- scripts/migrate.ts
  Reason: DB migrations to create/update the Postgres `messages` table and other schemas used by analytics/tools.

- sql/create_messages_table.sql
  Reason: Canonical CREATE TABLE for `messages` with indexes (ts_utc, sender, room_id, tsv, media_types GIN) so analytics tools and tests can run.

- src/decryption-manager.js (or .ts)
  Reason: Event-logger depends on a DecryptionManager for E2EE flows; provide a minimal stub for tests and a production implementation later.

- mcp-tools.js
  Reason: buildMcpServer helper used by src/mcp.ts (if not present or you want a variant). (Note: if already present, confirm exported API.)

- utils.js (verify it's present and matches utils.d.ts)
  Reason: many modules depend on runtime helpers (file logging, SQLite access, media downloader).

- src/index/search.ts (if you want a full BM25/hybrid search implementation)
  Reason: currently a stub; add a robust search implementation for better tool behavior.

- src/mcp/tools/sentimentTrends.ts and src/mcp/tools/sentimentDistribution.ts
  Reason: For production analytics you may expand SQL and smoothing/change-point detection.

- scripts/create_test_db.sh or test helper using pg-mem
  Reason: Simplify CI/unit tests by providing a reproducible in-memory Postgres (pg-mem) or Docker-based test DB.

- src/matrix/client.ts (verify implementation)
  Reason: sendMessage helper and other modules call matrix client helpers; ensure they are present and consistent.

If you'd like, I can prepare minimal starter versions for any of the above (migration SQL, decryption-manager stub, pg-mem test harness, or a simple scripts/migrate.ts). Tell me which ones you'd like me to add next.
