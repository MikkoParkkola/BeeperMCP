With auth.ts, crypto.ts, and decryption-manager.ts added, you already provided the key runtime modules I previously asked for.

Recommended next steps / notes:
- I don't need any additional source files to proceed with the TypeScript build. The repository already includes:
  - utils.js, mcp-tools.js
  - mcp tool implementations (src/mcp/tools/*.ts)
  - schema and type declaration files (mcp-tools.d.ts, utils.d.ts, matrix-js-sdk-shim.d.ts)
  - entrypoints: src/server.ts and src/mcp/server.ts

- Optional but helpful additions (only if you plan further changes):
  - scripts/migrate.ts (if you need DB migration logic executed during CI)
  - tests/ or a vitest config if you want automated tests in CI
  - a simple Dockerfile or GitHub Actions workflow for CI

If you'd like, I can now:
- Run more edits to ensure TypeScript compilation (fix any remaining implicit any / import path issues).
- Adjust any imports so they align with the tsconfig (NodeNext) output (e.g., ensure .js extensions in imports where required).
- Produce the exact SEARCH/REPLACE edits for any further fixes you want (type tweaks, minor runtime wiring, or build tweaks).

Tell me which of the optional items you want added or whether I should proceed to perform a TS build pass and fix any compile errors.
