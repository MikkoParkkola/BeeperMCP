Please clarify what changes you want to make to these files:

1) Goal
- What functionality should these files enable? (e.g., model selection, runtime config, provider registry)

2) Expected formats
- What is the intended format for each file?
  - model: plain text model id? e.g., "gpt-oss:120b"
  - set: shell script/CLI command? or a config directive?
  - config: JSON/YAML/TOML/plain text?
  - gpt-oss:120b: per-model settings in JSON/YAML? or just a marker file?

3) Desired behavior
- Should writing a model id into "model" switch the active model?
- Should "set" be an executable command to set the model?
- What keys/fields are required in "config" and per-model files?

4) Constraints
- Any existing tools/scripts that read these files?
- Any backward compatibility requirements?

Reply with the specifics and Iâ€™ll implement the exact schema and wiring.
